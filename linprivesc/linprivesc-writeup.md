# TryHackMe Linux Privesc Room
If you want to try this room yourself, you can find it at [tryhackme.com/room/linprivesc](tryhackme.com/room/linprivesc).
Unless otherwise specified, each task's machine has been accessed by clicking the "Start Machine" button to the right of that task's title, then clicking "Show Split View" near the top of the page to display the machine if it isn't already visible.
For the attacker (when necessary), I will be assuming you're using a (reasonably up-to-date) Kali Linux Distribution.
##Tasks 1 and 2
No answers are necessary here. Just read the tasks and make sure you understand their contents.
